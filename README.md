# CsLookup
Chrome extension for quick searching Csound manual for highlighted text or linking to sites useful to working with Csound on the web.

Notes: This has been tested to work in OSX and Windows, but due to how basic it is I assume it will work fine in Linux.


Usage:

  Either:
	1: Highlight text in chrome.
	2: Right click.
	3: Select "Csound Lookup".
	4: Select one of three Doc searches. (You'll get a 404 error if no match is found)

  Or:
	1: Without highlighting text, right click.
	2: Select "Csound Lookup".
	3: Select one of three Doc references, or one of six links to sites relevant to working with Csound on the web.


Installation Instructions:

	1: Download zip and unpack to a folder or manually clone the github repository
	2: Open Chrome's extensions page, under "More Tools"
	3: Enable "Developer Mode", the blue switch near the top right. (this is only needed for loading unpublished extensions)
	4: Click "Load Unpacked" near the top left.
	5: Select the folder repository is unpacked or cloned in.
  Optional (but recommended):
	6: Turn off extensions developer mode. (once installed, this option is no longer needed)
